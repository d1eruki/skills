# Frontend Verification

## Reuse Test Infrastructure

Before creating a test helper, fixture, source traversal, setup hook, parser, loader, matcher, or assertion utility, search the applicable test tree for an equivalent or extendable implementation. Reuse or extract a shared mechanism when it has the same contract and lifecycle.

When a repository requires change approval, include every affected test and shared helper in the plan. If duplication is necessary, explain the concrete incompatibility that prevents reuse.

## Design Durable Tests

Prefer tests for durable product guarantees and broad failure classes, including viewport containment, usable core controls, correct navigation, persisted critical preferences, and accessible state.

Do not add a test merely because code changed or a one-off bug was fixed. Add one when a critical guarantee is likely to regress and is not already covered. Prefer extending an existing broad test over creating a narrow test.

Avoid assertions for a single CSS class, utility, `z-index`, font family, or exact pixel value unless that value is an explicit product contract. Generalize the assertion or leave visual judgment to visual review.

Exercise behavior through real interactions and observable outcomes. Trigger hover in hover tests, resize the viewport in responsive tests, and verify usability or hit testing rather than implementation details.

## Verify Proportionally

Batch related edits and run the relevant verification set after the implementation batch instead of repeatedly rerunning the same checks after individual edits.

Keep production behavior, diagnostics, and tests distinct. Diagnostics and test scaffolding must not change product behavior, conceal a regression, or substitute for a product fix; remove temporary instrumentation before handoff.

For visual UI work:

1. Complete the scoped implementation.
2. Prepare the affected environments and states for the user to review, and clearly request their visual verification. Do not perform or claim visual approval on the user's behalf.
3. Apply the user's visual feedback within scope and return the result for another user review until they accept it.
4. Run the repository's formatter, relevant integrity or unit tests, and relevant browser tests.
5. If a relevant failure requires a visually meaningful code change, treat verification as incomplete and return the affected states for another user review after repeating the relevant automated checks.

For non-visual changes, skip visual review and run only relevant checks. Run a production build when build configuration, dependencies, asset processing, or production-only behavior is affected, or at the end of a larger integration batch.

Report unrelated or pre-existing failures separately and do not describe a suite as passing when relevant checks failed or were skipped.

Treat a batch as complete only when its observable acceptance checks, the user's required visual review, and relevant automated verification all pass. Until the user reports visual acceptance, describe automated verification as complete but visual verification as pending. When a relevant failure requires a file change, repeat the affected verification and request another user review when the visible result may have changed.
